mytuple = 'eggs', 'bacon', 'spam', 'tea'
print(mytuple)#prints entire tuple
print(mytuple[1])#bacon is the index number of 1 in list so just prints that
print(mytuple[-1])#

mytuple[2] = 'John' #tuples are immutable therefore cannot be changed, this this give an output of 'TypeError: 'tuple' object does not support item assignment. can be reassigned however, you can put something inside that is mutable.
